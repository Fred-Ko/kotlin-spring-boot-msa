# Avro4k-core Gradle Dependency Issue

- The dependency `com.github.avro-kotlin.avro4k-core:1.9.1` cannot be resolved from Maven Central or public repositories.
- The correct and actively maintained artifact is `com.sksamuel.avro4k:avro4k-core`.
- The latest stable version as of 2025 is `0.40.0` (see https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sksamuel.avro4k/avro4k-core/0.40.0)

## Solution
- Replace all usages of `com.github.avro-kotlin.avro4k-core:1.9.1` with `com.sksamuel.avro4k:avro4k-core:0.40.0` in all Gradle build files.
- This will resolve the build error and ensure the project uses a maintained and stable version.

## Next Steps
- I will now update the Gradle build files accordingly and retry the build.
